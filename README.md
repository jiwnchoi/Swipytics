# Swipytics

**Swipytics** is the simplest on-the-fly exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool using sequential visualization recommendations.

All you need to do is swipe! Swipytics automatically shows visualizations that help you understand your data.

## Getting Started

Swipytics runs in two enviornments: [Standalone](https://jiwnchoi.github.io/Swipytics), Server.

[Standalone](https://jiwnchoi.github.io/Swipytics) is run within the browser by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) without any additioanl installation or setup. Also Swipytics-stanalone can be installed in device as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)

Server runs on top of a Python web server and can be used via an instant Python environment like Binder or Colab, or by following the instructions below to install and use it. Swipytics running in the Server environment generates visualisations faster than Standalone.

## Installation ðŸš§

```shell
pip install swipytics
swipytics # Run Swipytics
```

## Development

### Setup Development Enviornment

Install [node.js](http://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) to set up the development environment.

You can manage both TypeScript (Frontend) and Python (Backend) environments with **_pnpm_**. Check the [`package.json`](https://github.com/jiwnchoi/Sequilt/blob/main/package.json).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiwnchoi/Swipytics.git
cd Swipytics
pnpm install

# Only works with Standalone (Pyodide).
pnpm dev

# Use server option if you want to work with Server.
pnpm dev:server

# Lint and Format
pnpm check # Lint and Format both .py and .ts files

# Test
pnpm test # Test TypeScript with Vitest and Python with pytest
```
